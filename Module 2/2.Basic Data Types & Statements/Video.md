| 0:04      | On completion of this lesson, you will be able to explain the basic data types and Solidity language, explain the use of visibility modifier public, illustrate the basic definition of functions, and apply the basic data types and functions in constructing a smart contract. Recall the concept that we discussed in course one. Externally owned account, contract account, transactions, and blocks. We use all of these in this lesson. We'll also use gas or crypto fuel that is paid for transaction execution, and an operation step as set by Ethereum Protocol. Remember, one ether is 10 power 18 Wei. Since operations consume gas, choosing appropriate and efficient data structures are important steps in constructing your smart contract. Solidity supports many of the basic types of a high-level language. We have given just a few. Default modifier is private. You explicitly state the public modifier, if that is what is intended. For every data declared public, accessor or getter function is automatically provided. Let us examine these concepts with a simple bidder example. The common statements available in any high-level language are available in solidity with very little variation. Assignment statement, if-else, why, for, etcetera. We learn them as we add code elements into the examples. We will develop bidder smart contract in incremental steps starting with the basic design representations shown here. Always design before you code. Let's move to the remix environment to work on this example. The bidder smart contract design is shown as a class diagram. It has three items; name of the contract, the data or states, the functions. The first version of the bidder contract, we add the data.                                        |
| 2:21      | The next thing that we want to do is look at the bidder data, and only the data. We're going to do some incremental development here. So, I have here the bidder contract and I have only the data, and you see that many of these state variables or data are public, and so, we should be able to access them from the web interface even without any functions. So let's compile and run them and create or deploy the smart contract, and I'm going to do that. I'm going to say create and you can see that it was created by this account number and the smart contract account number is here, and it is different from the account of the creator. The public variables are available here. You can see when you click on the bid amount, and you can see the $20,000 that was the initial value for the bid amount. Nothing else is eligible, it's initialized to false, name, we don't know the name. So, let's add the functions to this basic dataset of the state variables and complete the bidder contract.                                                                                                                              |
| 3:37      | Now that we have added the data, let's add the functions listed in the class diagram. We'll implement the two setters and the one that determined eligibility to bid. The code for this demo is in the resource section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3:57      | I'm going to go to the bidder sol that I pre-created for this. I added the functions here. The function setName that sets the name of the bidder and bid amount sets the bid amount. Determine the eligibility is a function that based on the state variable determines whether this bit is eligible or not. Let's go through and run it. I'm compiling it, running it, and this time I'm going to close the previous smart contract. I'm going to deploy one and new one and by clicking on the create button. You can see lot more functions here because we have added the public functions were set and determine eligibility. I'm going to chain the name of the set name to let's say "Amherst". So, I'm going to change the name and I'm going to obtain the bid amount to 330,000 and set amount setName, and let's look at and see whether these have been stored in the state variable. I'm clicking on the name. Buffalo has been changed to Amherst and I'm clicking on the bid amount and you can see that it has been changed to 30,000. We want to find out if this bid amount is eligible, and I'm clicking on the function "Determine eligibility," and that sets the variable eligible which is a public variable. Automatically, it has been given a getter function. I click on it, I get true. Yes, 30,000 is indeed higher than 1,000 and we got a true value. Let change the bid amount now to 300. Set the bid amount to 300, and determine the eligibility and then click, look at the bid amount it's 300. Look at eligible. It says false, and so, that illustrates the simple smart contract of the bidder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6:07      | We looked at a few simple data types and their usage through an example. This example should give enough background knowledge to select a type for your data, and use it in your application design. For more of the simple data types refer to solidity documentation in the resources.                                                                                                                                                    |
