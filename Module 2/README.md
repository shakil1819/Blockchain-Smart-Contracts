Our goal is to master the basics of Solidity, a high-level language that is a combination of Javascript, Java and C++. It is specially designed to write smart contracts and to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Learners will be able to follow demonstrations and practice using Solidity.

### Learning Objectives

---

- Explain basic data types in Solidity language.
- Explain the use of access modifier “public.”
- Illustrate the basic definition of functions.
- Apply the basic data types and functions in constructing a smart contract.
