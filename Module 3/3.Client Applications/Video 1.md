# Client Applications

![[Module 3/3.Client Applications/attachments/index_2.mp4]]We'll use solidity feature called Events to Interface with Client Application. We'll explain the concept of events: defining an event and pushing an event to a subscribed listener and illustrate the event using the Ballot example. First, a definition of event. A generic format is, event, name of the event, and parameters. For example, event votingCompleted. Here there are no parameters. Invoking an event is by the name of the event and any parameters. In the function vote, when the state changes to done, we invoke the event. We indicate that by invoking votingCompleted event. In the case of Ballot, we'll push this event at the end of the voting period. There are benefits to event logging. An event is pushed as opposed to regular function call that is pull to get an action performed. Typically, an event feature is to indicate to a client application, user interface or a transaction monitor that a significant milestone has been reached. The application can listen to the events pushed, using a listener code, to track transactions, to receive results through parameters of the event, initiate a pull request to receive information from the smart contract. We'll explore these event handlers in the next course when we discuss decentralized apps, dApps. Let's now review the entire smart contract with all these features added. In summary, we have developed the Ballot smart contract incrementally to illustrate various features including time dependencies, validation outside the function code before accessing the function using access modifiers, asserts and require declarations, and event logging.
