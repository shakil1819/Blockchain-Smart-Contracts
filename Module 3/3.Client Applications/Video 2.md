# Practitioner's Perspective: Shared Rules & Trust

These other problems that industry cared about like contract confidentiality. That means if I have a smart contract between you and me, I'll agree to give you three cookies if you give me four doughnuts. But if on Thursday at noon you give me your four donuts, I'll give you five cookies. But if LIBOR goes over six percent, I'll give you 20 cookies. I can write all those rules in any kind of code I want. The problem is if I write it in traditional client server code, if I have root access to the server, then you can't be sure that I can't change the rules. If you have root access to the control of the server, I can't be sure that you're not doing it or we have to trust some third party or the government and nobody wants that. So, that's the problem that blockchain for industry solves in that we can say we all have control, we all have control of our information, we all have had the control of agreeing on a set of rules between us, business rules. But none of us is in control of the system through which we're doing business, and that's the trick. It's a social problem that we are solving. We're solving a social problem. Among the problems that are out there to solve that are really interesting to me and to consensus and to the community, I think the domain of problems that are around governance, and I don't mean governing the blockchain. I mean, using the blockchain to govern. From where I sit, blockchain isn't about moving tokens around. I mean, that's just a feature. What the blockchain really presents as an evolution of the Internet is the notion of immutable shared rules, and here we are taping in Washington DC. I don't know, maybe Washington DC is the Silicon Valley of the next Internet because who knows shared rules? People around here. Treaties on the blockchain, taxes on the blockchain, regulations on the blockchain, and maybe even one day writing the code of a regulation or a law and debugging it before it's sent to Congress to pass. You could do that, you can do that with smart contracts. You could say here are the rules. If you're creating a security and it's real security and you're selling it to an American, then it needs to go through this process KYC or AML, and if you do that and it's an American citizen, then they need to be identified and then they need to be an accredited investor. If you can't get that as a station, then your token sale, for example, will not complete. All right. You could write those rules so that a token sale might be come one day the SCC or the CFTC's favorite security because it's the only one that can actually self-regulate in part. You can write the rules of the regulation around that transaction into the transaction so that the transaction simply can't complete without going through those rules. That'd be pretty cool, and be especially cool if we can start to do that over time in such a way that eventually our law-making process is itself in some part a little bit cody.
